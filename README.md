# ColecoDS
ColecoDS - A Colecovision and ADAM Emulator for the DS/DSi

_**Your Vision Is Our Vision...  COLECOVISION**_

To run requires a coleco.rom BIOS to 
be in the same directory as the emulator
or else in /roms/bios or /data/bios

Because the chips used in the Colecovision Hardware were so common in that era, other systems tended
to be very close to the CV in terms of hardware. Often only the IO/Memory was different. As such,
ColecoDS also allows cartridge and sometimes tape/disk games from "cousin" systems to be played - namely 
the Sord M5, the Memotech MTX, the SG-1000/3000, the Spectravision 3x8 SVI, Casio PV-2000, Hanimex 
Pencil II, CreatiVision, the Tatung Einstein and the venerable MSX1.

Thanks to the C-BIOS team for the open 
source MSX BIOS (see cbios.txt)

Thanks to Andy and his amazing Memotech 
Emulator MEMO which helped me get some
preliminary and simple MTX-500 support 
included.

Thanks to Darryl Hirschler for the keyboard graphics 
for the CreatiVision keypad, the ADAM keyboard,
the MSX keyboard and the MTX keyboard.

Thanks to Marcel de Kogel who wrote the Adam-EM 
emulator which is a bit of a grandfather to the
more modern emulators. I got the final bugs worked 
out of the VDP emulation and for disk drive
block caching on the ADAM thanks to his pioneering work.

Special thanks to  Marat Fayzullin, as the 
author of ColEM which is the code for the 
core emulation (specifically TMS9918 VDP
and the CZ80 CPU core).  I think the original 
port was circa ColEM 2.1 with some fixes and 
updated Sprite/Line handling from ColEM 5.6. 
Without Marat - this emulator simply wouldn't exist.

Known Issues and Limitations:
-----------------------
* No more than 1500 files per directory - split ROM files up as needed.
* Path and filename to a ROM can't be longer than 160 characters. Keep them on the shorter side.
* The original 2011 release of StarForce will crash - this is a known bug. There is a patched version of the game StarForce on Atariage.
* MSX envelope, Einstein and Sord M5 CTC sound and noise emulation is not perfectly accurate (but close enough).

BIOS Files :
-----------------------
Here are the BIOS file CRC32 hashes I'm using with all of my testing - seek these out if you want maximum compatibility:
```
* 3aa93ef3	coleco.rom (original version - rev 7)
* a30b0c34	coleco.rom (faster boot)
* 94ee12f3	msx.rom (MSX) - see below for more options
* c3c590c6	bioscv.rom (Creativision)
* a746eeb6	einstein.rom (Tatung Einstein)
* 338d7b59	pencil2.rom (Hanimex Pencil II)
* 8f31f297	pv2000.rom (Casio PV-2000)
* 92cf9353	sordm5.rom (Sord M5)
* bc433df6	svi.rom (Spectravision)
* 05a37a34	eos.rom (ADAM - rev 5/6)
* 58d86a2a	writer.rom (ADAM - rev 80)
```

For the MSX, we support a number of different (optional) BIOS ROMs. To be honest, after quite a bit of searching online, I'm not quite sure what machine the ubiquitous msx.rom represents - it's some generic European machine and from doing binary compares, it appears to be extremely similar to the Goldstar FC-200 or possibly the Casio MX-15 (11 bytes different in each). 

As such, ColecoDS will support additional optional MSX BIOS roms as follows (and you can select them in Configuration and set a global default if you like):

```
* 15e503de  cf-2700.rom - Panasonic CF-2700 UK Machine with 64K of RAM in Slot 1 and Cart in Slot 2
* e9ccd789  cx5m.rom    - Yamaha's UK/EU Machine with 32K of RAM in Slot 0
* 5486b711  hx-10.rom   - Toshiba's UK/EU Machine with 64K of RAM in Slot 2
* ee229390  hb-10.rom   - Sony HitBit JP Machine with 16K of RAM in Slot 0 (uses the Japanese keyboard matrix)
* 5ad03407  fs-1300.rom - National JP Machine with 64K of RAM in Slot 3 (uses the Japanese keyboard matrix)
* ee229390  pv-7.rom    - Casio PV-7 with just 8K of RAM! If you can't find this BIOS, use pv-16.rom as there is no difference in the binary.
```

Name the BIOS ROMs above exactly as shown (if you find them online, they will have longer names which will also generally work but to be safe, renaming is preferred) - place them into your usual BIOS directory. Once you select one of these optional BIOS roms (in Configuration), you will also enable that specific MSX machine to be emulated. This means RAM and memory slots will be exactly the same as the machine you're trying to emulate. See the MSX section for details on this.

ADAM Compatibility :
-----------------------
* The emulated ADAM will run most tape images (.ddp) or disk images (.dsk) - just pick the .dpp or .dsk image and it should auto boot (make sure you have all the ADAM BIOS files needed!)
* Three drive bays are emulated - two Disk drives at either 160K (SSDD) or 320K (DSDD) and a Tape drive at the standard digital data pack size of 256K. This should be enough for any program you want to run.
* The emulated ADAM is a 128K system (64K internal memory and 64K expanded RAM) - enough for almost any game or program. For the DSi and above with extra memory, this expanded ADAM ram is boosted to 2MB (32 banks of 64K each).
* By default, RAM is cleared when you reset the ADAM - you can change this to a random pattern on a per-game basis if you want.
* The 32K ROM expansion of the Adam is emulated - rename your expansion rom as ".adm" so that the emulator knows it's a special ROM designed to be in the expansion ROM area. You can also rename normal cart .rom files as .adm to load them up with proper Adam emulation (useful if you want to run some of the Adam carts like in-house diagnostics utilities in full Adam emulation mode... normally when you load a .rom it would just load up with standard Colecovision emulation).
* You can turn on the full ADAM keyboard with the Configuration of Overlays (choose 'ADAM KEYBOARD'). You can also use the keyboard/joystick icons to toggle between the keyboard and the joypad.
* The tape or disk images do NOT automatically write back to your SD card... you have to hit the little Cassette icon to make that happen (and only when the tape/disk is idle - it won't save if the tape/disk is busy reading/writing).
* Adam Sound Enhancer support is automatic - if a game tries to utilize the AY sound chip, it will be enabled.
* Due to screen constraints, the placement of keys on the virtual ADAM keyboard have been repositioned to maximize the 4x3 screen orientation - but all ADAM keys should be present and functional.

MSX Compatibility :
-----------------------
Considering this is a Colecovision emulator, the MSX1 support and compatibility is reasonably high.  In Game Options you will notice that the default MSX Mapper is set to "GUESS" which does a fairly good job loading the ROM - especially for 32K or smaller games. However, if a game doesn't run, you can try these suggestions:
* A small number of games don't work with the open-source C-BIOS. In this case you would need a real msx.rom BIOS. You can set this up in Game Options. If you have an MSX.ROM bios, it will use it by default.
* Most 64K games use the ASC16 memory mapper - so you can try that one... but a few (e.g. Mutants from the Deep) are linear mapped from 0-64K and you will need to pick LINEAR64 in Game Options. 
* The auto-detection on KONAMI8, KONAMI-SCC and ASCII8/16 mappers is pretty good... but some games don't detect well - you should try various mappers if the "larger than 64K" game won't run.
* SCC is emulated for the games that use that advanced Konami sound chip. If your game is < 64K rom size, it may not auto-detect Konami SCC as the mapper type - but you can override this in the config.
* Occasionally one ROM won't run but an alternate dump might. For example, the 384K version of R-Type is a bit of a mess for the emulator to handle, but someone made a clean 512K version that loads and runs great.
* With a little diligence in trying different mapping/BIOS combinations, you should be able to achieve a 97% run rate on MSX1 games. 
* MSX2 games are not supported and will not run - the VDP alone is different enough. Try MSXDS for a full-featured DS/DSi emulator for the full range of MSX computers.

MSX is not a single machine but a standard - there are lots of machines and lots of BIOS files. The one I did most of my testing is MSX.ROM with a CRC32 of 94ee12f3 - this is the one used by many other MSX emulators. ColecoDS also supports a number of other specific machines - see the BIOS section above for details on those roms.

MSX1 cassettes are supported in .CAS format. You can use the START and SELECT buttons for the common bload or run commands (or use the Cassette menu for more choices).

MSX1 disks are supported in .DSK format. The files must be raw sector dumps and the file must be exactly 360K (SS) or 720K (DS) in size to detect properly (very typical of the .dsk images you find 'out there').  If a program writes to a disk, be sure to use the Cassette/Disk menu and save the disk back out to the SD card if you really want the changes to stick.

The MSX memory is based on which MSX rom BIOS you are using:

Memotech MTX Compatibility :
-----------------------
The Memotech MTX runs at 4MHz which is faster than the Colecovision (and MSX, M5, SG, etc). This is reasonably well emulated - though the sound has minor inaccuracies due to some CTC chip timing differences from real hardware. About 90% of the games load and run properly. Sometimes you will have to run a [a1] or [a2] alternate dump of a game to get it to run properly.  When faced with the decision to use a .mtx formatted tape or a .com / .run, you should generally prefer the .mtx as it's closer to loading and running on a real machine. The excellent MEMU MTX emulator has a good selection of games.

There is support for the awesome MTX MAGROM project... there are several multi-carts in this project. You can use either 1.05 or 1.05a of the MAGROM binary file or the V2 MAGROM Binary... just rename as .MTX and load it normally and once the Ready prompt shows, press the START button to issue the "ROM 7" command to launch the multi-cart menu. It's worth it!

The MTX emulated is a base MTX-512 system with 64K of RAM... This should allow most games to run. A few games don't play nice with the MTX-512 and need the older MTX-500 base compatibility - those games should be auto-detected and run without any user intervention needed.

A small set of .COM files are supported. You can find these distributed in the MEMU emulator package.

Once the game is loaded into memory you will be sitting at the BASIC prompt. At this prompt you need to LOAD "" (if .MTX) or RUN the game (if .RUN). I've made this simple - just hit the DS **START** key to enter the proper command automatically. Alternatively, you will find the RUN commands in the Cassette Icon Menu.

Spectravideo SVI Compatibility :
-----------------------
This emulator will support .cas files for the Spectravideo SV-328 (64K machine). You can use the START and SELECT buttons for the common cload or bload commands (or use the Cassette menu for more choices). Cartridges are supported (.rom) up to 64K. There are only about a half-dozen carts available for this system (with most of the software being distributed on tapes).

Sega SG-1000 Compatibility :
-----------------------
This emulator supports .sg files as ROM loads up to 48K plus the few SMS mapper games up to 512K (Loretta no Shouzou: Sherlock Holmes and the SG-1000 port of Prince of Persia). Generally all SG-1000 games run with high compatibility (mostly thanks to the very simple architecture which is quite like the Colecovision).  The 8K Dahjee RAM expansion and additional RAM above 1K supported.

Sega SC-3000 Compatibility :
-----------------------
This emulator supports .sc files as ROM only (not cassettes) but ColecoDS will support the amazing SC-3000 Survivors Multi-Cart and MEGA-Cart. Strongly prefer the Multi-Cart as it's smaller and contains the same selection of tape games. Just rename the 2MB or 4MB binary as .sc to load in ColecoDS.  The emulation handles 32K of RAM in the upper memory area (so anything like Basic IIIb will work fine).

Casio PV-2000 Compatibility :
-----------------------
This emulator supports .pv files as ROM only (not cassettes).  Rename any .bin files you find as .pv so the emulator will load them correctly.

Sord M5 Compatibility :
-----------------------
This emulator supports .m5 files as ROM loads up to 20K. In addition, the EM-5 memory expansion is present giving an extra 32K of RAM beyond the stock 4K provided by the Sord M5. Generally all Sord M5 games run with high compatibility with just slight variations in sound emulation due to CTC chip emulation not being perfect.
There are two known games (Master Chess and Reversi) that won't run with the default JP NTSC BIOS. For these, you need the EU PAL BIOS (CRC32 of 0x78848d39) - you can install this as sordm5p.rom in the same BIOS directory and when you choose PAL for an M5 game, it will try to use the alternate ROM.


Hanimex Pencil II Compatibility :
-----------------------
There is only one known game dumped at this time:  Treasure Hunt. Fortunately it's a fun game!  Unfortunately, came on 2 ROM chips. So you have to "glue" the two ROMs together. If you can find a late MAME "Software List" from 2020 or later, you will find treasure.zip which contains two ROM files:
pen702a.bin (8k)
pen702b.bin (4k)
You need to glue these together. 

In windows use the command line:

copy /b pen702a.bin + pen702b.bin TreasureHunt.pen

or in Linux:

cat pen702a.bin pen702b.bin > TreasureHunt.pen

This should leave you with a 12k ROM called TreasureHunt.pen which is now playable on your ColecoDS system!

You can do the same thing with the BASIC cart (which has a 4K gap so we copy the 4K rom twice):

copy /b 203.bin + 1-or.bin + 1-or.bin + 202.bin BASIC.pen
cat  203.bin 1-or.bin 1-or.bin 202.bin > BASIC.pen


Tatung Einstein Compatibility :
-----------------------
The 64K TC-01 machine is emulated. Both .dsk files and .COM files will play. For both, you would load the file and press the START button to boot them (for .com files, it will load the file at 0x100 and auto-run... for .dsk files the START button will emulate the CTRL-BREAK needed to boot the diskette). Out in the interwebs, you will mostly only find .dsk files and the .COM files can be extracted from them. The easiest way is to use either Charlie Robson's einSDein-vitamins or EDIP to extract .COM files from disk images. Or just stick to .dsk files which are a bit more authentic to the experience of using a Tatung Einstein.

Two Tatung Einstein disk drives are supported. Both disk drives are standard single-sided, 40 track, 10 sector-per-track diskette with about 200K disk space available. 

Drive 0 is the main drive that will hold and load your .dsk file image when you run the emulation. 

Drive 1 is the secondary drive and, by default, will house a persistent "RAM" Disk that works like any other disk but is stored in /data/einstein.ramd and is always loaded every time you start Einstein emulation.  This comes pre-formatted (and you can re-initialize it using the DISK icon menu) with 200K of storage. To the emulator, it looks just like a standard second disk and is useful to hold often used programs and utilities - I use it to stash away a few flavors of XBAS so I've always got the right one on hand to play games. It's convenient to always have common utilities and programs available.

You can swap out either disk for another .dsk file as desired. 

Both drives support read/write capabilities however, the writing will NOT auto-back those changes to your SD card. I might change that behavior in the future - but for now, any changes written to the emulated disks are transient until you go into the DISK icon menu and save them back to the SD card. I'm fairly confident that the disk write works fine - but until I get more testing hours from field-use, I don't want to inadvertently screw up an original .dsk image and leave the onus on the user to save out the disk for now.

Speaking of disk images, there are several places to find them... but I would recommend seeking out the 'Tatung Einstein Gamebase' which generally has disk images properly formatted and auto-booting for a more streamlined experience. Seek those out.

One game in particular doesn't run right without tweaks:  Jet Set Willy 2. The game will run far too fast. To correct this, go into Config Settings for this game and on page 2 of the configuration, set the Einstein CTC timer to +5 (SLOWER). Additionally, you might also set the target emulation speed to 110%. This is a bit of a hack but these two setting changes will run the game fairly close to the way MAME would run it. Save the configuration and re-load the game to play at the 'right' speed. I'm still looking into the root cause.

Lastly, in addition to the standard 8K einstein.rom BIOS file (required for Einstein emulation), you can optionally provide an einstein2.rom file that will load (up to 8K) into 0x4000. This is the extra ROM slot in a real Einstein and can be used to house diagnostics roms or things like flexi-dos. 


CreatiVision Compatibility :
-----------------------
The VTech CreatiVision uses a different CPU - the m6502 (same as used in the Apple II). The system requires roms be renamed to .cv so the correct driver will load and the bioscv.rom must be present in the normal BIOS area. All known Creativision games and utilities run properly under ColecoDS. Games default to loading in "Legacy A/B" mode (meaning it will try to load into memory with the same locations/mirrors as the original commercial releases) but you can switch this to "Linear" which is a more modern way to load the game up against C000h or even 32k Bankswapped (many of the games have been converted to run on a MegaCart in this format where the two 16K banks are laid out in reverse order).

Cassette loading is not directly supported but you can load in BASIC listings from an ASCII source such as you would find at https://www.madrigaldesign.it/creativemu/ 
To get BASIC programs to work, you copy any CreatiVision BASIC ROM version and name it as the same base filename as the .BAS file. Note: there are 4 versions released and some CV BASIC games were designed for a specific version and might not run right in other versions.

For example, if you want to run kapooka.bas (a fun game!), take one of the basic ROM files and rename it kapooka.cv.  When you load kapooka.cv it will launch BASIC and then you can hit 
the little Cassette Icon to automatically load the corresponding kapooka.bas file into memory and run it.

For the CV enthusiast only: experimental loading of the CSL BIOS is allowed. If you take a 16K CSL BIOS (don't ask), and rename as .cv you can load it with this emulator. It will load up from C000h-FFFFh and you can enjoy the improved BIOS/BASIC functionality with a full 32K of expanded memory (much like a Laser 2001 or Salora Manager). If the emulator does not detect this as a valid CSL BIOS, you can force the issue in configuration (page 2:  set the CVISION load to BIOS).

Controllers :
-----------------------
You can map buttons to either P1 or P2 controllers. 
There is full support for Spinner X (P1) and Spinner Y (P2) or map 
both of them to get support for trackball games. These also work
for games like Turbo steering.  You can change the spinner sensitivity
to one of five different settings (Normal, Fast, Fastest, Slow, Slowest).
By default, the spinners are only enabled for the few games that use 
them - but you can force them by changing the Spinner Speed.

For the MSX emulation, the colecovision keypad is mapped to some of the
common keyboard keys -  enough to get most MSX1 cart games running...  
In Game Options you can also override the '?' key to be any mappable MSX key. 
For the few games that still require the MSX arrows to play - you can emulate 
that via the D-PAD in Game Options. You can also select a full-sized MSX keyboard
in game options (or in global options to set a default for MSX machines).

Keyboards :
-----------------------
A number of full keyboard overlays have been designed to bring more accuracy and enjoyment to the emulation. You can choose these on a per-game basis in Game Options configuration. 
If you choose 'Full Keyboard' you will get a keyboard that matches the style of the machine being emulated. Or you can choose 'Alpha Keyboard' for a simplified keyboard that is
a little easier to type on with your fingers (keys are a little bigger than they would be for specialized full keyboards - useful for text adventures where specialized keys aren't
usually needed).

Blend Mode (DSi) :
-----------------------
ColecoDS supports a "blend mode" which I borrowed from my scheme on StellaDS. In this mode, 
two frames are blended together - this is really useful when playing games like Space Fury or Galaxian 
where the bullets on screen are only 1 pixel wide and the DSi LCD just doesn't hold onto the pixels 
long enough to be visible. These games were designed to run on an old tube TV with phosphor which 
decays slowly so your eye will see slight traces as the image fades. This emulates that (crudely).
On the DSi using this new mode renders those games really bright and visible.

The DSi XL/LL has a slower refresh on the LCD and it more closely approximates the old tube TVs... 
so blend mode is not needed for the XL/LL models.

However! Using blend mode comes at an almost 10% CPU cost!! The DSi can handle it... the DS-LITE/PHAT might
struggle a bit on more complicated games. 

So my recommendation is as follows:
* DSi non XL/LL - use Blend Mode for the games that benefit from it (Space Fury, Galaxian, etc).
* DSi XL/LL - don't bother... the XL/LL screen decay is slower and games look great as-is.
* DS-LITE/PHAT - you can try it but the framerate might drop below 60 on some games.

To enable this new blend mode, pick your game and go into the "Game Options" sub-menu and turn it on.

Vertical Sync :
-----------------------
Vertical sync will force the update (refresh) of the screen when the DS goes into the vertical blank.
This reduces tearing and minor graphical artifacts but comes at a cost of speed. The DSi can handle
it for almost all games (Princess Quest is one game where you might turn it off) but the DS can only
handle it for the more simple games. So by default it's enabled for DSi and disabled for DS-LITE/PHAT.
You can toggle this in the "Game Options" (and START=SAVE it out as you wish). 

The Need For Speed :
-----------------------
If a game just isn't running at the right speed or has periods of slowdown (not
attributed to the actual game), here are the things you can try in the order I 
would personally try them:
* If it's a Colecovision game, make sure 'RAM MIRROR' is disabled. Only a few games need this (it will crash if you set it wrong).
* Turn off Vertical Sync
* Turn on Frame Skip - there are two settings here... show 3/4 (light frame skip) and show 1/2 (heavy frame skip)
* Set Max Sprites to 4

Compile Instructions :
-----------------------
devkitpro-pacman version 6.0.1-2
gcc (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.3.0
libnds 1.8.0
I use Ubuntu and the Pacman repositories (devkitpro-pacman version 6.0.1-2).  I'm told it should also build under 
Windows but I've never done it and don't know how.

If you've got the nds libraries above setup correctly it should be a matter of typing:
* _make clean_
* _make_

To build the emulator. The output of this is ColecoDS.nds with a version as set in the MAKEFILE.
I use the following standard environment variables that are SET on Ubuntu:
* DEVKITARM=/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM
* DEVKITPPC=/opt/devkitpro/devkitPPC
* DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro

To create the soundbank.bin and soundbank.h (sound effects) file in the data directory:

mmutil -osoundbank.bin -hsoundbank.h -d *.wav

And then move the soundbank.h file to the arm9/sources directory
